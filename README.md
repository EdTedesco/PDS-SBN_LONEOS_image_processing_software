#### This repository contains the software used to create the [Planetary Data System / Small Bodies Node (PDS-SBN) LONEOS Archive V2.0](https://doi.org/10.26033/ms2j-v867).

Each script or pipeline (which is a set of linked scripts) is in its own Branch. The Branches are in roughly the chronological order in which the images were obtained as described in more detail in [loneos_processing_details_v2.pdf](https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/surveys/gbo.ast.loneos.survey/document/loneos_processing_details_v2.pdf)[^1]. 

A preliminary version of loneos_processing_details_v2.pdf is available [here](loneos_processing_details_v2.pdf).

The hardware consisted of a Windows PC running Microsoft Windows 11 Pro x64 with multiple NVME m.2 Solid State Drives (SSDs). Where a Windows program was unavailable, or not as efficient, a Linux version was used running Ubuntu v20.04.6 under Microsoft [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)]( https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl) and both Windows and Linux versions of Python[^2] (.py) were used. [Windows PowerShell]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5) (.ps1) and Linux and Windows batch scripts (.sh) and [TCC version 29](https://jpsoft.com/downloads/v29/tcmd.exe)[^3] (.btm) were also used. In addition, Ubuntu was run under a [montage38 environment](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu).

Branch [Renaming_f-formatted_ds_images](https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ds_images) contains the script to rename double-spaced f-formatted images recovered from backup tapes.

Branch [Renaming_f-formatted_ss_images](https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ss_images) contains the script to rename single-spaced f-formatted images recovered from backup tapes.

Branch [lois_none_double-spaced_pipeline](https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/lois_none_double-spaced_pipeline) contains the scripts to create augmented images and their .csv labels from the original renamed lois_none double-spaced images.
[^1]: NOTE: Because the PDF linked to here is at an external site it will open in your browser, and its links will work as expected. This is unlike PDFs in GitHub whose links are non-functional. When you have finished viewing this PDF, and any links reached from within it you will need to use the browser's go back button to return to GitHub. Alternatively, you can right-click the PDF link and open it in a new window or tab. However, if you want full functionality in navigating within the PDF you will need to download it and use an actual PDF reader (*e.g.*, Adobe Acrobat) to read it. However, even then you will not be able to link to the pseudo-links in orange font due to the PDS's prohibition on links to "non-permanent" sites. In these cases, you will have to copy and paste these orange links into your browser to reach them.
[^2]: The version of Python used was: “Python 3.8.13 (default, Mar 28 2022, 11:38:47)”
[^3]: TCC is a replacement Windows command processor that is compatible with existing CMD commands and batch files while adding hundreds of new commands. More recent versions would also probably work.
