This page describes the software used to crteate the LONEOS Planetary Data System / Small Bodies Node (PDS-SBN) Archive and contains links to the scripts that are being archived here (because the PDS/SBN does not allow software to be archived). 

Each script is in its own Branch. The Branches are in roughly the order in which the images were processed as described in loneos_processing_details_v2.pdf 

Branch https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ss_images contains the script to rename single-spaced f-formatted images recovered from backup tapes.

Branch lois_none_double-spaced_pipeline (https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ds_images) contains the scripts to create augmented images and their .csv labels from the original renamed lois_none images.

See LONEOS processing details (https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/surveys/gbo.ast.loneos.survey/document/loneos_processing_details.pdf).
