This page describes the software used to create the LONEOS Planetary Data System / Small Bodies Node (PDS-SBN) LONEOS Archive and contains links to the scripts that are being archived here (because the PDS/SBN does not allow software to be archived). 

Each script or pipeline (which is a set of linked scripts) is in its own Branch. The Branches are in roughly the order in which the images were processed as described in more detail in loneos_processing_details_v2.pdf (https://sbnarchive.psi.edu/pds4/surveys/gbo.ast.loneos.survey/document/loneos_processing_details.pdf). Because this is being written prior to LONEOS Archive V2.0's release these links are to the existing version in LONEOS Archive V1.0 and are therefore of little practical use.

Branch Renaming_f-formatted_ds_images (https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ds_images) contains the script to rename double-spaced f-formatted images recovered from backup tapes.

Branch Renaming_f-formatted_ss_images (https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ss_images) contains the script to rename single-spaced f-formatted images recovered from backup tapes.

Branch lois_none_double-spaced_pipeline (https://github.com/EdTedesco/PDS-SBN_LONEOS_image_processing_software/tree/Renaming_f-formatted_ds_images) contains the scripts to create augmented images and their .csv labels from the original renamed lois_none double-spaced images.
